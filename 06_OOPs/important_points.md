1. What is OOP?
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. It utilizes several principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to create objects that interact with one another to solve a problem.

2. what is instance?
    When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object (an instance of the class) is created. Each instance has its own unique set of attributes and can interact with other instances and methods defined by the class.

    Instance: A specific object created from a class.
    Instance Attributes: Variables that hold data specific to the instance.
    Instance Methods: Functions that operate on the instance.
    Unique State: Each instance maintains its own unique set of attributes and can have different states from other instances.

3. What are attributes?
    Attributes: Variables that belong to a class or an instance of a class.
    Instance Attributes: Specific to an instance; defined in the constructor using self.
    Class Attributes: Shared among all instances of the class; defined outside any methods.
    Attributes store data relevant to the objects and can be accessed using the dot notation.

4. What are the four main principles of OOP?
    The four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:
        
        a. Encapsulation:
        Definition: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and can prevent the accidental modification of data.
        --> A double underscore __ triggers name mangling, which makes the attribute or method more difficult to access from outside the class (private).
        --> Benefits: Protects the internal state of the object, ensures control over the data, and promotes modularity and code reusability.

        b. Abstraction:
        Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.
        Benefits: Simplifies the user interface by providing only relevant information and functionalities, reduces code complexity, and enhances maintainability.

        c. Inheritance:
        Definition: Inheritance in Python is an object-oriented programming concept where a new class (called a child or subclass) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (called a parent or superclass). This allows the subclass to reuse the code from the superclass, extending or modifying its behavior without duplicating code.
        Benefits: Promotes code reusability, establishes a natural hierarchy, and enables the implementation of polymorphic behavior.
        super() Function: A built-in function that allows you to call methods from the parent class

        d. Polymorphism:
        Definition: Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
        The main idea behind polymorphism is that the same function or method can behave differently on different objects.
        Benefits: Enhances flexibility and integration, allows for dynamic method binding, and supports method overriding and overloading.

5. What is an object in Python?
    An object in Python is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, it acts as a blueprint for creating objects. Each object created from the class can have its own attributes (data) and methods (functions) that define its behavior.

6. What is method overriding in Python?
    Method Overriding: A feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
    Same Method Signature: The overridden method must have the same name, parameters, and return type as the method in the superclass.
    super() Function: Used to call the superclass method from within the overriding method.
    Benefits: Enhances flexibility, promotes code reusability, and supports polymorphism.

7. What is a constructor in Python?
    Constructor: A special method named __init__ used to initialize the attributes of a class.
    Automatic Call: Called automatically when a new instance of the class is created.
    Self Parameter: Refers to the instance being created and allows access to its attributes and methods.
    Default Values: Constructors can have default values for parameters.

8. What is multiple inheritance in Python?
    Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This means a subclass can be derived from multiple base classes, combining the functionalities of all the parent classes.

    When the same method is defined in multiple parent classes, Python resolves the method to use based on the Method Resolution Order (MRO).

9. What is the super() function in Python?
    super() Function: Allows access to parent class methods from within a subclass.
    Basic Usage: Helps call methods from the parent class without explicitly naming it.
    Multiple Inheritance: Ensures correct method resolution order in complex inheritance hierarchies.
    Benefits: Enhances code reusability, maintainability, and proper method resolution in multiple inheritance.

10. How does Python handle method resolution order (MRO) in multiple inheritance?
    This algorithm ensures a consistent and predictable order in which methods are resolved when dealing with multiple inheritance. The MRO determines the order in which base classes are searched when a method is called, ensuring that each class is only visited once.

11. Can you explain the difference between composition and inheritance?
    Inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class (subclass or derived class) is created from an existing class (superclass or base class). The subclass inherits attributes and methods from the superclass, and can also override or extend them.

    Composition is a design principle where one class contains a reference to one or more objects of other classes, allowing it to use their functionalities. This relationship is known as a "has-a" relationship.

12. What is a metaclass in Python?  
    A metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. In other words, a metaclass is responsible for creating classes, just as a class is responsible for creating objects. Metaclasses allow you to control the creation and behavior of classes at a higher level, providing a way to customize class construction and behavior.
